            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>The increasing demand for sustainable and maintenance-free energy sources has led to the development of innovative energy harvesting technologies. This study focuses on designing and optimizing a MEMS-based energy harvesting device using piezoelectric materials to convert beta particle energy from a radioactive isotope into electrical energy. By varying the thickness, length, and width of the piezoelectric materials, the study aims to maximize displacement and voltage output. The device features a copper cantilever structure to efficiently capture electrons emitted by a Nickel-63 source.</p>

            <h1>Literature Survey</h1>
            <p>Energy harvesting technologies have gained significant attention over the past two decades as alternatives to conventional power sources for small-sized and low-power electronic devices. The need for periodic recharging or replacement of batteries has been a consistent issue for portable, remote, and implantable devices.</p>
            <h1>Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</h1>
            <p><strong>Definition and Mechanism:</strong> Piezoelectric energy harvesting converts dynamic mechanical energy into electrical energy using piezoelectric materials. This method focuses on harvesting low-level energy (microwatts to milliwatts) to power low-power electronics.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Piezoelectric transduction is advantageous over thermal and solar harvesting because ambient vibrations are persistent due to operational conditions, making it reliable and useful in embedded systems where thermal and solar energy might be absent.</p>
            <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Common applications include providing energy for low-power electronics such as embedded electronics, implantable biomedical devices, wireless sensor nodes, and portable electronics. These systems offer a permanent, autonomous power source, reducing costs associated with battery replacement and enabling deployment in remote or embedded locations.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="methodology">
            <h1>Methodology</h1>

The cantilever's dimensions were optimized to enhance energy conversion efficiency. A copper cantilever, with dimensions 500 µm × 100 µm × 2 µm, was selected to effectively capture electrons from the Nickel-63 source.</p>

        <h1>Addendum</h1>
        <p>
            In creating this HTML document, I have chose to present my research paper titled 
            "Shape and Material Optimization of Piezoelectric Transducers for Energy Harvesting." 
            In This document I have used semantic HTML tags such as &lt;header&gt; for the main title 
            and &lt;nav&gt; for navigation which allows users to easily jump between sections.
        </p>
    
        <h1>Font Choices</h1>
        <p>
            I selected <strong>Arial</strong>, a sans-serif font, as it is having good readability and clean appearance. Sans-serif fonts are used 
            due to clarity for online content.
        </p>
    
        <h1>Heading and Text Sizes</h1>
        <p>
            For main title I have used a the font size of <strong>3em</strong>, so that it is visible with bigger font compared to other headings and it is easy to notice. For other section headings i used  size <strong>2em</strong>, so that i can show the difference as it is given we should not use any h2 tags. For paragraph i have used the size 
            <strong>1.1em</strong>, so that we can easily identify that it is a paragraph. 
        </p>
    
        <h1>Color Choices</h1>
<p>
    I chose a <strong>rgb(39, 118, 182)</strong> for background color for the body, Becuase it looks good and peacefull for my self so used it.The text color is set to <strong>white</strong>, so that the contrast will be high comparing with the background and which will ensure the readability. For navigation links, I have choosed  <strong>black</strong>, 
    so that we can find them as links and differentiate them when compared to the other texts  
    The navigation menu has a <strong>rgba(41, 133, 213, 0.397)</strong> background, 
    so that it can appear as other section like navigation section which is easily differentiated with the main content.
</p>
        <h1>Margin and Padding Choices</h1>
        <p>
            The document's overall padding is set to <strong>20px</strong>, so that it creates a comfortable 
            space between the content and the edges of the viewport.this will help us to set our text not clumsy alltogether. Headings have a margin-bottom of <strong>15px</strong>, which helps 
            separate them from the following content and improves readability.The navigation has <strong>10px</strong> of padding to check that the links are 
            spaced evenly and are easily clickable.
        </p>

            In summary, I have used a combination of font choices, sizes, colors, and 
            spacing so that it will create a well-structured and good looking visually good webpage. This design will enhance the user experience as he can navigate from one section to other easily as it is the research paper so users will definetly want to switch from one section to other so i have designed my web page and styled it like this.
